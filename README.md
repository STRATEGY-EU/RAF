# RAF

Within the [ResiStand project](http://resistand.eu/), the ResiStand Assessment Framework was created. It is an [Excel tool](https://github.com/STRATEGY-EU/RAF/blob/main/RAF%202.0_20180430.xlsx) to support organisations or individuals in assessing the impact of a possible standardisation project and the feasibility of developing and implementing it in the domain of disaster resilience and crisis management. Please consult the [guideline]((https://github.com/STRATEGY-EU/RAF/blob/main/RAF%202.0_Guideline_ds_20180430.pdf)) for instructions how to use it.
